# React PWA Notification Experiment

Welcome to the React TypeScript PWA project, where I explore the exciting world of notifications in Progressive Web Apps. In this project, I'll guide you through the process of requesting user permission and showing notifications.

## Project Overview

This project follows a standard PWA development structure, complete with components, screens, and a context for managing global states. To bring our design to life, I've used a combination of Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Navigate to your desired directory and use the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>

2. **Install Dependencies:** Next, install the project dependencies using Yarn. This will ensure you have all the necessary packages to run the app:


   ```bash
   yarn install
